# Hello World
This site is meant to be a place where I can gather resources around my career in tech. I might share some thoughts I have on different topics (platform engineering, devops, cloud native, etc), slides from presentations I've done, links to recordings if available and what else might come up! 

I look forward to see where this will go! Either I will continue to fill it out and keep it alive and healthy, or maybe this is the last update we'll see.. Stay tuned!
