## Abstract
As a small team there is a lot of leverage to be gained from using cloud native projects, but the task might seem daunting and something that you need to have a very large organisation to have any use of. This couldnâ€™t be further from the truth! Join this case study and learn how Jessica and her team of three and a half Platform Engineers revolutionized the developer experience for 30 developers at Annotell with the help of cloud native projects.
