## Abstract
Key takeaways
* You will learn how to keep the DevOps culture and still focusing on delivering product value
* You will learn about Platform Engineering and why you should care!
* You will gain insights in navigating the minefield of autonomy and paved roads

With DevOps being a state of the art mindset we find ourselves with autonomous teams who can take full ownership and not only develops features but also follow up on their usage, put them in production and fix them when they break. Without operations teams, the develops need to care about things such as logging, metrics and container orchestration. How can we get our developers to spend more time on building their product and less time on all the tooling? Join this session to learn how Platform Engineering is the key to make DevOps work in real life!
